## Development Process

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pharmatech-morocco.git`
3. Add upstream remote: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/pharmatech-morocco.git`
4. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

### Coding Standards

#### Kotlin Style Guide

Follow the official [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html):

```kotlin
// Good
class PharmacyRepository @Inject constructor(
    private val pharmacyDao: PharmacyDao,
    private val apiService: ApiService
) {
    fun getNearbyPharmacies(lat: Double, lng: Double): Flow<Resource<List<Pharmacy>>> {
        // Implementation
    }
}

// Bad
class PharmacyRepository @Inject constructor(private val pharmacyDao:PharmacyDao,private val apiService:ApiService){
    fun getNearbyPharmacies(lat:Double,lng:Double):Flow<Resource<List<Pharmacy>>>{
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

#### Compose Best Practices

```kotlin
// Good - State hoisting
@Composable
fun PharmacyScreen(
    viewModel: PharmacyViewModel = hiltViewModel()
) {
    val state by viewModel.state.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    
    PharmacyContent(
        pharmacies = state.pharmacies,
        onPharmacyClick = viewModel::onPharmacyClick
    )
}

@Composable
private fun PharmacyContent(
    pharmacies: List<Pharmacy>,
    onPharmacyClick: (String) -> Unit
) {
    // UI implementation
}
```

#### Documentation

* Add KDoc comments for public APIs
* Include usage examples for complex functions
* Document non-obvious code behavior

```kotlin
/**
 * Calculates medication adherence rate over a specified period.
 *
 * @param userId The user's unique identifier
 * @param days Number of days to analyze (default: 7)
 * @return Flow emitting adherence percentage (0-100)
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * viewModel.getAdherenceRate("user123", 30).collect { rate ->
 *     println("30-day adherence: $rate%")
 * }
 * ```
 */
fun getAdherenceRate(userId: String, days: Int = 7): Flow<Float>
```

### Testing

* Write unit tests for ViewModels and Repositories
* Write UI tests for critical user flows
* Aim for >80% code coverage
* Run tests before submitting PR: `./gradlew test`

```kotlin
@Test
fun `getAdherenceRate returns correct percentage`() = runTest {
    // Given
    val userId = "test_user"
    val expectedRate = 85.5f
    
    // When
    val result = repository.getAdherenceRate(userId).first()
    
    // Then
    assertEquals(expectedRate, result, 0.1f)
}
```
