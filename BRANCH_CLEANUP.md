## üéØ Recommended Actions

### Immediate Cleanup (Safe to Delete)

These branches can be safely deleted as their work is already in master:

```bash
# Delete claude/system-patching branch (DEX fixes are in master)
git push origin --delete claude/system-patching-011CUW3dzhiuzpZ6CiAHmqkf

# Delete compyle/app-deployment-ready (auto-commit branch)
git push origin --delete compyle/app-deployment-ready
```

### Verify Before Deletion

Check if these changes are in master before deleting:

```bash
# Check claude/android-emulator-issues branch
# Verify pharmacy map features exist in master before deleting
git push origin --delete claude/android-emulator-issues-011CUUuv1ZKaDN3kM6Q9NzUG
```

## üìã Branch Naming Conventions

To prevent future confusion, follow these conventions:

### Permanent Branches
- `master` - Production code
- `dev` - Development integration

### Temporary Feature Branches
- `feature/feature-name` - New features (e.g., `feature/barcode-scanner`)
- `fix/bug-name` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/login-crash`)
- `refactor/scope` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/repository-pattern`)
- `docs/topic` - Documentation (e.g., `docs/api-guide`)

### AI Assistant Branches
- `claude/*` - Claude AI work (delete after merge)
- `copilot/*` - GitHub Copilot work (delete after merge)
- `compyle/*` - Compyle agent work (delete after merge)

**Rule**: AI assistant branches should be deleted within 7 days of creation or immediately after merge.

## üîß Cleanup Script

Use the provided `cleanup-branches.sh` script to safely clean up old branches:

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x cleanup-branches.sh

# Run in dry-run mode first (shows what will be deleted)
./cleanup-branches.sh --dry-run

# Run actual cleanup
./cleanup-branches.sh
```

---

## üìä Recommended Branch Structure

After cleanup, your repository should have:

```
bentalba/pharmatech-morocco
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ master              (protected, production-ready)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev                 (protected, active development)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/* branches  (temporary, short-lived)
```

### Branch Protection Rules

Consider adding these GitHub branch protection rules:

**For `master` branch:**
- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews (1+ approvals)
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date
- ‚úÖ Restrict who can push (maintainers only)

**For `dev` branch:**
- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Allow force pushes (for rebasing)

---

## ‚úÖ Cleanup Checklist

Use this checklist when cleaning up branches:

- [ ] Verify branch work is in master/dev
- [ ] Check for unique commits not in main branches
- [ ] Document any important information from branch
- [ ] Delete remote branch: `git push origin --delete branch-name`
- [ ] Clean up local tracking branches: `git fetch --prune`
- [ ] Update this document with new branch status
- [ ] Notify team members if branch was collaborative

## üö® Important Notes

### Before Deleting Any Branch

1. **Check for unmerged work**: `git log master..branch-name`
2. **Verify no open PRs** reference the branch
3. **Check if anyone else is using** the branch
4. **Document important commits** before deletion

### Cannot Be Recovered

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Deleted branches cannot be easily recovered. GitHub keeps deleted branch references for 30 days, but it's better to be certain before deleting.

### Safe Deletion Criteria

A branch is safe to delete if:
- ‚úÖ All commits are merged into master/dev
- ‚úÖ No open pull requests reference it
- ‚úÖ No team members are actively working on it
- ‚úÖ It's older than 7 days with no activity
- ‚úÖ It's an AI assistant branch with completed work

## üìû Questions?

If you're unsure about deleting a branch:
1. Run `git log master..branch-name` to see unique commits
2. Ask the team if anyone is using it
3. Create a backup: `git tag archive/branch-name branch-name`
4. Document why you're keeping it in this file

## üîÑ Maintenance

- Creating new long-lived branches
- Changing branch naming conventions
- Adding branch protection rules
